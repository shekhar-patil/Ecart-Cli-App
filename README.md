# ECart

This is Ruby CLI application.

In this project I am exploring power of metaprogramming in Ruby and trying to add similar methods like Rails application as the following:
    Associations:
        * has_many
        * has_one

    Validation:
        * Uniqueness

    Terminal command using Thor gem(This gem is also used by Rails) as following:
        * e_cart user create
        * e_cart user show
        * e_cart product create
        * e_cart cart my_cart
